## Validation Checks Performed

The application analyzes uploaded datasets and flags common data quality risks:

- Missing values detection
- Duplicate encounter or claim IDs
- Future-dated records
- Basic structural validation

These checks simulate real-world data validation performed during onboarding and system implementation projects.

## Why This Project Exists

During implementation and onboarding projects, large datasets often contain hidden issues that delay go-live.

This tool demonstrates how lightweight AI-assisted validation can quickly surface risks before deployment.
