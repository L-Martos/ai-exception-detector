## Validation Checks Performed

The application analyzes uploaded datasets and flags common data quality risks:

- Missing values detection
- Duplicate encounter or claim IDs
- Future-dated records
- Basic structural validation

These checks simulate real-world data validation performed during onboarding and system implementation projects.
